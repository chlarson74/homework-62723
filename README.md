## Description 

[View the webpage](https://chlarson74.github.io/homework-62723)

The project is a begining webpage portfolio to accompany the work I accomplish in the Full-Stack Developer Bootcamp. All but the first projects listed are fake projects so far. In time they will be replace with real projects. 

Work completed:
- Downloaded stock images from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com) reduced the pixel density of the provided images to 72ppi for faster page load speed.
- created simple wireframes to help visualize and plan the design and code.


## Usage 

Webpage deployed online is accessible through a web browser like Google Chrome.


## Learning Points 

- Used Semantic HTML because it is important for Search Engines to fully understand each part of our webpage. They provide more context than a generic div tag.
- Reduced the image files. Smaller image files will keep you website running fast and light. It is important to break down those 300 dpi images into 72 ppi image for the web.
- I created and used simple wireframes to plan the design. I wrote the code based on the simple wireframes I created.
